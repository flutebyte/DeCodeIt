## ðŸ“Œ Notes

This was my first full-stack project. I made mistakes, looked things up, and asked questions â€” but I stayed committed to learning and completing it myself.

Iâ€™m proud of how much Iâ€™ve grown through this project, and Iâ€™m even more excited to build the next one with stronger foundations.
